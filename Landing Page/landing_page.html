    <h1 class="feature-heading">GEOGRAPHY</h1>
    
    <p id="para1"> <img class="feature-img1" src="C:\Users\Asus\OneDrive\Documents\project\html\Landing Page\geography.jpg">The Maldives is a nation of islands in the Indian Ocean, that spans across the equator. The country is comprised of 1192 islands that stretch along a length of 871 kilometers. While the country covers an area of approximately 90,000 square kilometers, only 298 square kilometers of that is dry land. The islands are grouped into a double chain of 26 atolls.
      The country’s unique geography mesmerizes the visitor. Reefs that offer bands of color, tiny jewel-like islands rimmed with the whitest of soft sand surrounded by the clearest shallow waters that one can imagine. Only 200 of the islands are inhabited, and a select few on each of the atolls are resorts and some of the islands are used for industry and agriculture.
      The beauty of the Maldives is not only above the water. The Maldives is home to about five percent of the planet’s reefs that comes with an explosion of color contributed by soft and hard corals that form them. The reefs are home to a thousand species of fish. Lured by the rich nutrients that flow in with the currents, large pelagic fishes such as manta rays and whale sharks also make the Maldives their home.</p><br>
        
        <h2 class="feature-heading">THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        
        <p id="para2"><img class="feature-img2" src="C:\Users\Asus\OneDrive\Documents\project\html\Landing Page\environment.jpg"> The Maldives has one of the most delicate environments anywhere on the planet. Coral reefs are the foundation of the islands. They offer protection to the tiny islands as its natural defense system, and the country’s economy depends heavily on the health of its reefs and ecosystems.
          Several conservation efforts are underway to protect the valuable marine environment of Maldives. While several marine species and birds are protected by law, protected areas have been designated to ensure the conservation of specific ecosystems and the rich biodiversity of the country. This includes designated nature reserves in islands of various atolls to protect wetlands and mangroves and the protection of marine areas and the designation of biosphere reserves that covers coral reefs, islands, sea grass beds and mangroves.
          Several resorts too conduct their own programs. While some programs conducted by resorts focus on the protection and rehabilitation of sea turtles, others are engaged in cutting edge research on regeneration of coral reefs. Several community education programs are also conducted by resorts for school children and the community at large. Non-governmental organizations also play an important role through their voluntary programs and conduct regular beach and reef clean up programs.
          Visitors to Maldives are advised to carry back their own non-biodegradable waste and to take care not to stand on, touch or remove coral structures while snorkeling or diving.</p>
        
        <h2 class="feature-heading">EXOTIC</h2>
        <p id="para3"><img class="feature-img3 "src="C:\Users\Asus\OneDrive\Documents\project\html\Landing Page\exotic.jpg">The Maldives is blessed with about 5% of the global reef area, and 250 species of coral, teeming with over 1000 species of fish. Nearly half those who visit the Maldives snorkel or dive and experience the colorful world beneath the surface. While some dedicate their holiday entirely to experience the magic underwater, others take a more leisurely approach. A dive center is an essential component of any resort and there are more than one dive centers in most of the guesthouse islands. Liveaboards carry their own dive gear if the tour is dedicated to diving and all liveaboards without exception would carry a collection of snorkeling equipment.
          For a leisurely snorkel you can just wade from the beach to the house reef on most islands. Resorts and guesthouses also organize their very own snorkeling excursions. If you intend to dive, just visit the dive school on the island as soon as you arrive. The dive guides would work out a schedule for you to suit your requirement. Dive schools offer dive courses leading to certification from beginner level to advanced and dive courses are conducted in many languages.</p>
